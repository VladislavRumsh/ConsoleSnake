# ConsoleSnake

**ConsoleSnake** is a console-based snake game implemented in C++ using an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. The project is modular, with different aspects of the game such as entities (fruits and the snake), rendering, and input handling separated into distinct classes and files for clear organization and maintainability.

## Current Features

- Game grid visualization within the console.
- Real-time snake movement and control.
- Collision detection with walls and fruit.
- Score system to track player progress.
- Multi-threaded input handling for a responsive gaming experience.

## Upcoming Features

- Snake growth mechanics to increase the snake's size as it consumes fruits.
- A main menu and settings for adjusting game difficulty and other preferences.
- Enhancements to the user interface for an improved player experience.

## System Requirements

- C++ compiler (C++17 or higher recommended).
- The game is currently compatible only with Windows, as it uses Windows-specific system calls.

## Compilation and Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory on a Windows machine.
2. Compile the source files with a C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable to begin playing the game.
