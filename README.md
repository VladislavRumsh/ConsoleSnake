# ConsoleSnake

**ConsoleSnake** is a console-based snake game developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project showcases a modular design, with key functionalities such as entity management (fruits and snake), rendering, and input handling divided into distinct classes and files for enhanced organization and maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Game Grid Visualization**: Effectively displays the game within a console environment, offering a clear and functional grid layout.
- **Real-Time Snake Movement and Control**: Provides responsive and intuitive control of the snake's movement for smooth gameplay.
- **Advanced Collision Detection**: Efficiently handles collisions with walls, fruits, and the snake's own tail to enrich the gameplay dynamics.
- **Score System**: Incorporates a scoring mechanism to track and display player progress.
- **Multi-threaded Input Handling**: Ensures responsive gameplay by managing user input in a separate thread.
- **Customizable Game Settings**: A fully implemented main menu and settings allow players to adjust game parameters such as grid size and snake speed, enhancing player engagement.

## Recent Updates

- **Implemented Main Menu and Settings**: A functional main menu and settings feature has been added, enabling players to customize various aspects of the game.
- **User Interface Enhancements**: Continuous improvements to the user interface, including adjustments to the help window and other textual elements.

## Future Plans

- The current focus is on refining the existing codebase, including cleaning, sorting, and updating comments for enhanced readability and maintainability. No additional features are planned until this phase is complete.

## System Requirements

- Requires a C++ compiler (C++17 or higher recommended).
- Compatible with Windows platforms, utilizing Windows-specific system calls.

## Compilation and Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository on a Windows machine.
2. Compile the source files using a C++ compiler.
3. Execute the compiled program to start the game.
